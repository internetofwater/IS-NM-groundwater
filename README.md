# IS-NM-groundwater
Independent Study New Mexico Groundwater data

## Notes
The old data is in this repository : https://github.com/internetofwater/NM_groundwater

The **nm_groundwater_updated** folder consolidates all the data and code into a single folder. The OSE data were too large to put on GitHub, but may be downloaded here: http://geospatialdata-ose.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ose-points-of-diversion.

The code to pull, clean, and create files for rendering on the web are located in a single file: nm_groundwater_updated/code/crosswalk.r
